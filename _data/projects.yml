# Renderer
- project: Image Renderer based on Path Tracing
  role: Course Project for Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 2021 Spring, Tsinghua University
  duration: June, 2021
  # url: "#"
  description: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Implemented features for a renderer, including texture mapping, parametric surfaces, depth of field and bounding box acceleration of complex meshes.</li><li>Code is based on a framework provided by the course TAs, but path tracing and the above features are implemented individually.</li></ul>

# Sniffer
- project: Packet Sniffer on FPGA
  role: Group Project for Digital Logic Design 2021 Spring, Tsinghua University
  duration: April, 2021; June, 2021
  description: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Created a packet sniffer able to list information about passing packets, based on a Xilinx FPGA board with Ethernet and VGA interface</li><li>I utilized an <a href="http://alexforencich.com/wiki/en/verilog/ethernet/start">open source Verilog library</a> in my code to extract and pass on relevant information from the Ethernet interface.</li></ul>
